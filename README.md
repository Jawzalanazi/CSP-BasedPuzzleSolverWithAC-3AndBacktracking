# CSP-BasedPuzzleSolverWithAC-3AndBacktracking
This project implements a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) solver for grid-based puzzles using AC-3 (Arc-Consistency) and Backtracking algorithms. The solver attempts to assign values to grid cells while satisfying a set of constraints (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) between assigned values.
